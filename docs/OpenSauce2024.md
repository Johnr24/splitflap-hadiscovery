# What's a split-flap display?
A [split-flap display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display) is an older electro-mechanical display technology that used to be common in airports and train stations.

Despite their complexity, split-flap displays have a few advantages compared to modern LED/LCD displays, like:
- ðŸ”‹ requires no power (when static)
- ðŸ’¡ no "glow" of a light-based display
- ðŸ”Š makes a sound to call your attention to new information (like when your flight becomes delayed!)
- ðŸ˜Ž sounds and looks sweet

But they have one BIG disadvantage: maintenance ðŸ™€

# How do I build one?
Check out the [github repo](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap)!

I sell some of the custom parts in my [Etsy store](https://bezeklabs.etsy.com) for convenience, but it's open source so you're always welcome to build things or have them manufactured yourself!

The [splitflap community Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wgehm3PcrC) is the best place to keep up with the latest changes or ask questions about the project!

# Why????
I love old mechanical technology, and I'm always a little sad when beautiful mechanical solutions are replaced by (far more practical) big, bright, colorful LEDs, so I sought to recreate split-flaps with more modern hobbyist-friendly tools.

It's become a passion project of mine over the last 9 years, and I LOVE seeing the displays and art installations others have built based on my open-source design!
